| General topic?               | Insulin imbalance may not be the only cause of the onset of diabetes. Researchers have now highlighted another mechanism: the liver appears to have the ability to produce a significant amount of glucose outside of any hormonal signal. In patients with excess liver fat, this overproduction of glucose could lead to type 2 diabetes, regardless of hormonal circuits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Scientists inactivated the OPA1 function in mice to be able to analyze the exact role of mitochondria. The liver of mice that do not have the long form of OPA1 loses its ability to produce sugar in just a few weeks. Liver cell mitochondria then show an altered morphology, confirming their importance in sugar metabolism. By observing controls, i.e. healthy mice in which OPA1 had been introduced in its long form, we discovered that, when equipped with these "super-mitochondria," they generated more glucose than necessary, and their liver produced sugar without any hormonal call.
|  Conclusions/discovery       | This is the first time that glucose production by the liver has been observed independently of an external signal, and particularly hormonal. This finding may explain the development of type 2 diabetes in patients with a "fatty liver" syndrome, apart from any apparent insulin imbalance.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  Remaining question?         | Can overproduction of glucose in liver cells trigger diabetes?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
