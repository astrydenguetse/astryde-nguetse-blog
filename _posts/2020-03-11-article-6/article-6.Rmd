|  General topic?              | Scientists have, for the first time, discovered a family of proteins that are associated with lower blood sugar levels among obese patients with type 2 diabetes, implying that those proteins are associated with a better control of the patient's disease.                                                            |
| Procedure/what was examined? | IL-36 cytokines are members of a larger family of proteins known as the interleukin-1 family which have emerged as central players in the development of obesity related disease. Researchers have linked the protective effects of these proteins with their ability to alter the make-up of the intestinal microbiome. |
| Conclusions/discovery        | The study showed that patients with type 2 diabetes who have high levels of the protein, IL-36 cytokines, were found to have lower blood sugar levels, implying that those proteins are associated with better control of the patient's blood sugar levels and their disease.                                            |
|  Remaining question?         | what is the impact of cytokines IL-36 on the development of metabolic diseases in humans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
