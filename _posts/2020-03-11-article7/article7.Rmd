|  General topic?              | Researchers have discovered a circuit in rats that links cigarette smoking and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Procedure/what was examined? | To investigate the association between Tcf712, nicotine addiction, and blood glucose regulation, researchers genetically deleted Tcf712 in rats. The mutant rats consumed much greater quantities of nicotine than animals in which Tcf7l2 functioned normally. Deletion of Tcf7l2 resulted in diminished nicotinic receptors in the medial habenula and consequently, reduced ability of nicotine to activate the habenula's aversion circuit. Unexpectedly, while the loss of Tcf712 function in the habenula increased nicotine consumption in rats, this change also reduced nicotine-driven blood glucose increases and protected against the emergence of diabetes-associated abnormalities in blood glucose levels.If these findings in rats extend to human cigarette smokers, they suggest a dynamic in which variations in the Tcf712 gene might influence both the risk of tobacco addiction and the development of tobacco-associated type 2 diabetes |
| Conclusions/discovery        | Nicotine use leads the pancreas to release less insulin, which raises the level of blood sugar; higher levels of blood sugar are associated with a higher risk of diabetes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  Remaining question?         | can we use a particular brain circuit can be targeted to treat diabetes in smokers and maybe even in non-smokers ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
