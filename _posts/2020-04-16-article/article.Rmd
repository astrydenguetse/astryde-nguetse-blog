# CONCLUSION

Reached the end of our work where it was a question of talking about the factors that influence type 2 diabetes. It is clear that several factors such as age, heredity, overweight, influence this disease in its own way. But the main risk factor for DT2 is lifestyle. A diet that is too fatty and too sweet, combined with a sedentary lifestyle (lack of physical exercise), leads to obesity which is in itself a major risk factor for diabetes. The standard treatment for type 2 diabetes, which must be started before any other, is therefore a change in lifestyle, including: weight loss when necessary regular physical activity, a balanced diet. These measures may be sufficient to control blood sugar. But these changes are often difficult to implement and accept for the patient.
